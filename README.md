### Description

flagser computes the homology of directed flag complexes. For a more detailed
description consult the documentation under `docs/documentation_flagser.pdf`.

### Building

Flagser requires a C++14 compiler and cmake. Here is how to obtain, build, and
run flagser:

```sh
git clone git@gitlab.com:luetge/flagser.git
cd flagser
(mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j)
./test/run
```

### Running

To call flagser you run

```sh
./flagser --out example.homology test/medium-test-data.flag
```

For more detailed instructions, see `docs/documentation_flagser.pdf`. 

You can run `flagser` with the argument `--in-memory` which changes `flagser` 
internals storing the full directed flag complex in memory, speeding up parts 
of the computation but requiring more memory.

Included in this package is also the original program `ripser`, modified only
in that the features of `flagser` are supported.

### Euler characteristic and cell counts

To only compute the Euler characteristic and cell counts, run

```sh
./flagser-count example.flag
```
